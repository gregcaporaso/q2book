    "# Beta diversity\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter we'll continue our exploration of metrics of microbiome diversity. We'll next discuss metrics of **beta diversity**, which are measures of \"between-sample\" diversity. I think of these as metrics that are computed based on pairs of samples. \n",
    "\n",
    "The beta diversity metrics that we'll cover in this chapter are distance and dissimilarity metrics. These are always computed on a pair of samples, and most typically they will be computed on all pairs of samples in a feature table. If a distance is computed between a pair of samples, it results in a single positive value. If distances are computed between all pairs of samples, the result is a distance matrix. The distance matrix is indexed by sample ids on both axes, and individual distances can be looked up from that matrix. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Distances and distance matrices\n",
    "\n",
    "The distance between two samples is the opposite of the similarity between two samples, so if two samples have a large distance between them that means they are more dissimilar to one another. If they have a small distance between them, that means they are similar to one another. Distances between microbiome samples typically aren't interpreted in isolation, but rather contextualized by other distances. \n",
    "\n",
    "The meaning of a distance between samples depends on the specific distance metric that is being used. Stepping back from biology for a moment, imagine that we're computing the distance between two cities. There are various ways that we could measure this, and the way we choose to measure it depends on what we need to do with that distance. For example, we could draw a straight line between the two cities on a map, measure that line, and we'd have a distance between the cities. But, if we're driving between the cities, that distance won't be very relevant unless there is a road that connects the cities by the line that we've drawn. In this case, a more relevant distance will be that of the shortest drivable route between the two cities. Just as there are many ways to compute the distance between two cities, there are many ways to compute the distance between biological communities. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because distances between microbiome samples are generally contextualized by other distances between microbiome samples, we generally compute distances between all pairs of samples at the same time. We can then work with the full distance matrix, or look up distances for specific pairs of samples that we're interested in from the distance matrix. Here's an example of a feature table, and a distance matrix containing Jaccard distances between three samples. (We'll learn about Jaccard distances later in this chapter.)\n",

    "Just as phylogenetic alpha diversity metrics can be more informative than non-phylogenetic alpha diversity metrics, phylogenetic beta diversity metrics offer advantages over non-phylogenetic metrics such as Bray-Curtis. The most widely applied phylogenetic beta diversity metric as of this writing is unweighted UniFrac. UniFrac was initially presented in [Lozupone and Knight, 2005, Applied and Environmental Microbiology](http://aem.asm.org/content/71/12/8228.abstract), and has been widely applied in microbial ecology since (and the illustration of UniFrac computation presented below is derived from a similar example originally developed by Lozupone and Knight).\n",

    "To illustrate how UniFrac distances are computed, before we get into actually computing them, let's look at a few examples. In these examples, imagine that we're determining the pairwise UniFrac distance between two samples: a red sample, and a blue sample. If a red box appears next to an OTU, that indicates that it's observed in the red sample; if a blue box appears next to the OTU, that indicates that it's observed in the blue sample; if a red and blue box appears next to the OTU, that indicates that the OTU is present in both samples; and if no box is presented next to the OTU, that indicates that it's present in neither sample.\n",

In these examples, we color all of the *observed* branch length. Branch length that is unique to the red sample is red, branch length that is unique to the blue sample is blue, and branch length that is observed in both samples is purple. Unobserved branch length is black (as is the vertical branches, as those don't contribute to branch length - they are purely for visual presentation).\n",

OTU 2 is only observed in our blue sample, so the terminal branch leading to OTU 2 is blue (i.e., unique to the blue sample). However, the internal branch leading to the node connecting OTU 1 and OTU 2 leads to OTUs observed in both the red and blue samples (i.e., OTU 1 and OTU 2), so is purple (i.e, observed branch length, but not unique branch length).

    "\n",
    "Here we used ANOSIM testing whether our with and between category groups differ. This test is specifically designed for distance matrices, and it accounts for the fact that the values are not independent of one another. For example, if one of our samples was very different from all of the others, all of the distances associated with that sample would be large. It's very important to choose the appropriate statistical test to use. One free resource for helping you do that is [*The Guide to Statistical Analysis in Microbial Ecology (GUSTAME)*](http://mb3is.megx.net/gustame). If you're getting started in microbial ecology, I recommend spending some time studying GUSTAME.\n",

    "#### Hierarchical clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, let's look at a hierarchical clustering analysis, similar to that presented in panel G above. Here I'm applying the UPGMA functionality implemented in [SciPy](http://www.scipy.org/scipylib/index.html) to generate a tree which we visualize with a dendrogram. However the tips in this tree don't represent sequences or OTUs, but instead they represent samples, and samples with a smaller branch length between them are more similar in composition than samples with a longer branch length between them. (Remember that only horizontal branch length is counted - vertical branch length is just to aid in the organization of the dendrogram.)\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> from scipy.cluster.hierarchy import average, dendrogram\n",
    ">>> lm = average(human_microbiome_dm.condensed_form())\n",
    ">>> d = dendrogram(lm, labels=human_microbiome_dm.ids, orientation='right',\n",
    "...                link_color_func=lambda x: 'black')\n",
    "<Figure size 432x288 with 1 Axes>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, we can see how the data really only becomes interpretable in the context of metadata:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> labels = [human_microbiome_sample_md['body site'][sid] for sid in sample_ids]\n",
    ">>> d = dendrogram(lm, labels=labels, orientation='right',\n",
    "...                link_color_func=lambda x: 'black')\n",
    "<Figure size 432x288 with 1 Axes>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> labels = [human_microbiome_sample_md['individual'][sid] for sid in sample_ids]\n",
    ">>> d = dendrogram(lm, labels=labels, orientation='right',\n",
    "...                link_color_func=lambda x: 'black')\n",
    "<Figure size 432x288 with 1 Axes>\n",
    "```\n",

    "### Ordination\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, let's look at ordination, similar to that presented in panels A-D. The basic idea behind ordination is dimensionality reduction: we want to take high-dimensionality data (a distance matrix) and represent that in a few (usually two or three) dimensions. As humans, we're very bad at interpreting high dimensionality data directly: with ordination, we can take an $n$-dimensional data set (e.g., a distance matrix of shape $n \\times n$, representing the distances between $n$ biological samples) and reduce that to a 2-dimensional scatter plot similar to that presented in panels A-D above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordination is a technique that is widely applied in ecology and in bioinformatics, but the math behind some of the methods such as *Principal Coordinates Analysis* is fairly complex, and as a result I've found that these methods are a black box for a lot of people. Possibly the most simple ordination technique is one called Polar Ordination. Polar Ordination is not widely applied because it has some inconvenient features, but I find that it is useful for introducing the idea behind ordination. Here we'll work through a simple implementation of ordination to illustrate the process, which will help us to interpret ordination plots. In practice, you will use existing software, such as [scikit-bio](http://scikit-bio.org)'s [ordination module](http://scikit-bio.org/maths.stats.ordination.html).\n",
