    "# Machine learning in bioinformatics\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter we'll begin talking about machine learning algorithms. Machine learning algorithms are used in bioinformatics for tasks where the user would like an algorithm to assist in the identification of patterns in a complex data set. \n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning algorithms generally are provided with a table of **samples** and user-defined **features** of those samples. These data are typically represented in a matrix, where samples are the rows and features are the columns. This matrix is referred to as a **feature table**, and it is central to machine learning and many subfields of bioinformatics.\n",
    "\n",
    "As is typically the case in this book, we'll work through implementing a few algorithms but these are not the implementations that you should use in practice. The code is written to be accessible for learning. [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/) is a popular and well-documented Python library for machine learning which many bioinformatics researchers and software developers use in their work. If you'd like to start trying some of these tools out, scikit-learn is a great place to start. \n",
    "\n",
    "scikit-learn also defines a few example feature tables that we can look at here to get an idea of what typical input looks like in a machine learning task.\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- TODO: pick up here to discuss the features tables. then swap order of unsupervised and supervised learning to illustrate what you can do if you don't have labels and then what you can do if you do have labels-->"

    "There are a few different high-level tasks that are common in machine learning. Possibly the most commonly used in bioinformatics are supervised classification and ordination, and we'll experiment with both in this chapter. \n",
    "\n",
    "In a supervised classification task, a user provides examples of data that fall into certain discrete classes (for example, _healthy_ and _disease_), and tries to have the computer develop a model that can differentiate those classes based on the defined features. If successful, the resulting model could be applied to data where the class isn't known ahead of time, in attempt to predict the class from the features. \n",
    "\n",
    "Unsupervised classification tasks, on the other hand, generally don't have classes or labels assigned ahead of time, and the user is hoping to identify which samples are most similar to each other based on new features that are defined by the algorithm. The goal here might be to reduce the number of features from thousands or more to around two or three that explain most of the variation in the data. This allows the user to explore the samples visually, for example in a scatter plot, which would not be feasible if there were thousands of features.\n",

    "We'll begin our exploration of machine learning approaches with **supervised classification**, and specifically with an algorithm called **Naive Bayes**.  We'll implement Naive Bayes to gain an understanding of how it works, and I think you'll discover that this idea of machines learning isn't quite as mysterious or science fiction-y as it sounds. The math involved in Naive Bayes is relatively straight-forward, which is why I chose this algorithm to present here. There are many machine algorithms with more complex math, but Naive Bayes is  widely used and powerful, so it's a good place to get started. \n",
    "\n",
    "We'll explore supervised classification in the context of a now familiar topic: taxonomic classification of 16S rRNA sequences. We previously explored this problem in {doc}`database-searching`, so it's worth spending a few minutes skimming that chapter if it's not fresh in your mind.\n",
    "\n",
    "Briefly, the problem that we are going to address here is as follows. We have a query sequence ($q_i$) which is not taxonomically annotated (meaning we don't know the taxonomy of the organism whose genome it is found in), and a reference database ($R$) of taxonomically annotated sequences ($r_1, r_2, r_3, r_n$). We want to infer a taxonomic annotation for $q_i$. We'll again work with [Greengenes](http://greengenes.secondgenome.com/), a 16S rRNA sequence database, which we'll access using [QIIME default reference project](https://github.com/biocore/qiime-default-reference). (This should all sound very familiar - if not, I again suggest that you review {doc}`database-searching`.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get to this though, lets talk about what supervised classification algorithms are and how the classifiers they build are evaluated. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Defining a classification task\n",
    "\n",
    "In a classification task, there are two or more pre-defined classes, and the goal is to assign observations to those classes. As humans, we run perform these kinds of tasks everyday. For example, if you're browsing a bookstore you might classify titles as ones you want to read versus everything else (the ones you're not interested in reading). You might group the apps that you have on your phone into folders by classifying them by category (e.g., \"school\", \"entertainment\", or \"social media\"). \n",
    "\n",
    "When we're working with large data sets, supervised classification algorithms can help us with classification tasks that will make us more efficient or help us understand our data. A classic example of this outside of bioinformatics is an email spam filter. For every email that is received, the spam filter must define it as spam or not spam so the message can directed either to the user's spam folder or the user's inbox. The stakes can be high: a filter that is too permissive will cause the user's inbox to get filled with junk mail, while a filter that is overly restrictive could cause relevant messages to be directed to the spam folder. In either case, the email user could miss important messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of taxonomic assignment, our classes will be taxonomic groups at a user-defined taxonomic level. For example, a phylum classifier for 16S rRNA sequences would take an unannotated sequence as input and as output present the phylum that the sequence most likely originated from.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Training data, test data, and cross-validation\n",
    "\n",
    "Supervised classification algorithms need to be provided with data that is used to develop a model to use in classification (in other words, to train the classifier). This data is a collection of observations with defined classes, and is referred to as the **training data**. These labeled examples are the \"supervision\" aspect of supervised learning. In the email spam filter example, this would be email messages that are annotated as either spam or not spam. In the 16S taxonomy assignment example, this would be 16S sequences that are taxonomically annotated. It is typically important that the training data be balanced - in other words, that there are roughly the same number of examples of each class.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the training data, an independent collection of observations with defined classes is needed as **test data**. These observations are not used to train the classifier, but rather to evaluate how the classifier performs on previously unseen data. The goal of testing the classifier on these test data is to predict what performance will be on **real world** data. Real world data refers to data for which the class is currently unknown. In the spam filter example, real world data would be new emails that you are receiving. In the 16S rRNA taxonomy assignment example, real world data could be sequences that you obtain from the environment using a DNA sequencing instrument. The test data shouldn't be used for optimization of classifiers: in other words, you shouldn't develop a classifier on training data, test it on test data, go back and make changes to the classifier, and then re-test on test data. This would risk **over-fitting** the classifier to a particular test data set and performance on that test data may no longer be predictive of how the classifier will perform when it is used on real world data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because training and test data sets can be very costly to develop (for example, they may require many hours of annotation by humans) we often use an approach call **k-fold cross validation** during classifier development and optimization {numref}`cross-validation-1`. In k-fold cross-validation, the training data is split into `k` different data sets, where `k` is usually five or ten. In each of the data sets, $1/k$ of the entries are used as test data and all of the other entries are used as training data. In `k` iterations, the classifier is developed on the training data and tested on the test data. The average performance of the classifier is then computed across the `k` iterations. k-fold cross validation therefore allows for developing and optimizing a classifier without using dedicated test data.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Evaluating a binary classifier \n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned above, in a classification task there are two or more pre-defined classes. A binary classifier would be a specific type of classifier for which there are exactly two classes - for example, spam and not spam. We'll start talking about how classifiers are evaluated by discussing binary classifiers because they're the easiest to understand. \n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine we're building a classifier that attempts to predict whether an individual is healthy or has some specific disease (let's call it *Disease X*). Perhaps the data that the classifier uses is based on a variety of medical data that has undergone a feature extraction process to generate features that can be used by a supervised classification algorithm. When a classifier is developed, you can think of it like a function that will take a collection of features for a sample and return a value of \"healthy\" or \"diseased\". \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of our classifier is to serve as a diagnostic tool that identifies whether a patient has Disease X based on features of their medical data. A positive test result therefore indicates that the patient has Disease X while a negative test result indicates that they are healthy. When we apply our classifier to test data (i.e., where we know the correct class), there are a few possible outcomes. \n",
    "\n",
    "* The classifier predicts a positive test result, and the sample is known to come from a patient with Disease X. This is a **true positive (TP)**. \n",
    "* The classifier predicts a positive test result, and the sample is known to come from a healthy patient. This is a **false positive (FP)**. FPs are also referred to as type 1 errors.\n",
    "** The classifier predicts a negative test result, and the sample is known to come from a patient with Disease X. This is a **false negative (FN)**. FNs are also referred to as type 2 errors.\n",
    "* The classifier predicts a negative test result, and the sample is known to come from a healthy patient. This is a **true negative (TN)**. \n",
    "\n",
    "A classifier would typically be evaluated by running it on many samples and tallying the count of TP, FP, FN, and TN results. These tallies are typically presented in a structure known as a **confusion matrix**. For the confusion matrix, there many different values that can be computed which inform us of some aspect of classifier performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest way to think about evaluating the performance of our classifier from a confusion matrix is to compute its **accuracy** as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    ":label: accuracy\n",
    "accuracy = \\frac{TP + TN}{TP + FP + FN + TN}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In words, accuracy can be defined as the fraction of the total test cases that the classifier classified correctly. Accuracy gives us an idea of the classifier performance, but it hides some potentially relevant information from us. A low accuracy classifier could, for example, almost never achieve false positives but frequently achieve false negatives. Such a classifier could still be a clinically useful tool. Because false positives are very infrequent but false negatives are common, that means when the classifier indicates a positive test result that person nearly always has the disease. If the classifier indicates a negative result, that could be an indicator that additional testing is needed. Of course we would rather our classifier achieve fewer false negatives, but if this is a very cheap test and the additional tests are more expensive, it could be a useful first screening approach. \n",
    "\n",
    "Two other metrics are more widely used for evaluating classifiers, and these are typically computed as a pair. These metrics are **precision** and **recall** and they are more informative than accuracy because they indicate whether a classifier might suffer more from false positives or false negatives. \n",
    "\n",
    "Precision is the fraction of the positives reported by the classifier that are actually positives, or:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    ":label: precision\n",
    "precision = \\frac{TP}{TP + FP}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall is the fraction of the actual positives that are reported to be positive by the classifier, or:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    ":label: recall\n",
    "recall = \\frac{TP}{TP + FN}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Precision thus tells us how frequently our classifier yields false positives, while recall tells us how frequently our classifier yields false negatives. We of course would always like both of these values to be high, but depending on the application of our classifier, we may prefer high precision over high recall, or we may prefer high recall over high precision. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Naive Bayes classifiers\n",
    "\n",
    "Naive Bayes classifiers work by building a model of what different classes look like based on labeled training data. In the case of taxonomic assignment of 16S sequences, the classes are different microbial taxonomy names at a given taxonomic level. For example, Proteobacteria and Cyanobacteria would be two classes if we were building a classifier for bacterial phyla. The data that is provided would be the 16S sequences associated with different representatives of the classes, but more specifically Naive Bayes needs these sequences broken into finer-grained features for it to work well. The development of features from raw training data is referred to as **feature extraction**. This can be part of the classifier training software, or it can be independent. Features of sequences could be nearly anything, such as sequence length, presence or absence of certain sequence patterns (or motifs), GC content, and so on. The most commonly used features for sequence classification tasks such as this is {ref}`overlapping kmers <kmer>`, which we have previously seen when looking at heuristic algorithms for database searching. In this case, feature extraction for a given sequence would involve the identification of all of the kmers contained in that sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, instead of using sequence alignment to identify the most likely taxonomic origin of a sequence, we'll train Naive Bayes classifiers to do this by building {ref}`kmer <kmer>`-based models of the 16S sequences of taxa in our reference database. We'll then run our query sequences through those models to identify the most likely taxonomic origin of each query sequence. Since we know the taxonomic origin of our query sequences in this case, we can evaluate the accuracy of our classifiers by seeing how often they return the known taxonomy assignment. If our training and testing approaches are well-designed, the performance on our tests will inform us of how accurate we can expect our classifier to be on data where the actual taxonomic origin is unknown. \n",
    "\n",
    "We'll begin by {ref}`preparing our reference database and query sequences as we did previously <load-qdr>`."

    "To train our taxonomic classifier, we next need to define a few things. First, at what level of taxonomic specificity do we want to classify our sequences? We should expect to achieve higher accuracy at less specific taxonomic levels such as phylum or class, but these are likely to be less informative biologically than more specific levels such as genus or species. Let's start classifying at the phylum level to keep our task simple, since we're working with a small subset of the reference database here. In Greengenes, phylum is the second level of the taxonomy.\n",

    "Next, how long should our kmers be? We don't have a good idea of this to start with. The longer our kmers, the more likely they are to be specific to certain taxa, which is good because that will help with classification. However, if they get too long it becomes less likely that we'll observe those kmers in sequences that aren't represented in our database because the longer the sequence is the more likely we are to see variation across other organisms that are assigned to the same taxonomy. Based on some of my own work in this area, I'll start us out with 7-mers (i.e., kmers of length 7).\n",

As a result, 0.5 is added to the numerator and 1 is added to the denominator. When we alter counts in this way, we refer to the values that we're adding as **pseudocounts**. \n",

    "$P(w_i | taxon)$ : The probability of observing a kmer given a taxon. Again, it would seem that this would be computed as the proportion of sequences in the taxon containing the kmer, but this would neglect that we'll likely observe kmers in our query sequences that are not represented in our reference database. A pseudocount is therefore added again to the numerator and denominator. This time the pseudocount in the numerator is scaled by how frequent the kmer is in the reference database as a whole: specifically, it is $P_i$.\n",

We'll pull these at random from our reference sequences, which means that some of the query sequences will be represented in our reference database and some won't be. We'll also trim out 200 bases of our reference sequences since (as of this writing) we typically don't obtain full-length 16S sequences from a DNA sequencing instrument. We're thus trying to emulate a real-world classification of environmental 16S rRNA sequences, where some might be perfect matches to sequences we've observed before while others might represent previously unobserved sequences (or even previously unknown organisms)."

    "For a given query sequence, its taxonomy will be classified as follows. First, the set of all kmers will be extracted from the sequence. This is referred to as $V$. Then, for all taxa in the kmer probability table, the probability of observing the query sequence will be computed given that taxon: $P(query | taxon)$. This is computed as the product of all its kmer probabilities for the given taxon.

Chances are however that if you run the above steps multiple times you'll get the wrong taxonomy assignment at least some of the time. Up to this point, we've left out an important piece of information: how confident should we be in our assignment, or in other words, how dependent is our taxonomy assignment on our specific query? If there were slight differences in our query (e.g., because we observed a very closely related organism, such as one of the same species but a different strain, or because we sequenced a different region of the 16S sequence) would we obtain the same taxonomy assignment? If so, we should have higher confidence in our assignment. If not, we should have lower confidence in our assignment. This is additionally important because our classifier will _always_ return one of the classes, even if our query sequence is very different than any of the sequences in our reference database.\n",

    "We can quantify confidence using an approach called bootstrapping. With a bootstrap approach, we'll get our taxonomy assignment as we did above, but then for some user-specified number of times, we'll create random subsets of V sampled with replacement. We'll then assign taxonomy to each random subset of V, and count the number of times the resulting taxonomy assignment is the same as the one we received when assigning taxonomy to V. The count of times that they are the same divided by the number of iterations we've chosen to run will be our confidence value. If the assignments are often the same we'll have a high confidence value. If the assignments are often different, we'll have a low confidence value.\n",

    "We'll next turn our exploration of machine learning approaches to **unsupervised learning**, and specifically discuss ordination methods. We'll work through ordination in two strokes. First, we'll explore an approach called **Polar Ordination**, where the math is simple but which isn't widely used in practice because it doesn't work well on large data sets. Working through this on a small data set will give you an idea of how ordination techniques can reduce the dimensionality of a data set and how to interpret the results of an ordination. Then, we'll apply an approach called **Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCoA)**. The math for PCoA is a bit more complicated than I want to get into in this book (I'm a biology teacher, after all), but we'll apply it to a large data set to explore how these techniques can be used in practice.\n",
