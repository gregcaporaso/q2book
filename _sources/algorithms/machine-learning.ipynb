    "# Machine learning in bioinformatics\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter we'll begin talking about machine learning algorithms. Machine learning algorithms are used in bioinformatics for tasks where the user would like an algorithm to assist in the identification of patterns in a complex data set. \n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning algorithms generally are provided with a table of samples and user-defined features of those samples. These data are typically represented in a matrix, where samples are the rows and features are the columns. There are a few different high-level tasks that are common in machine learning. Probably the most commonly used in bioinformatics are supervised classification and dimensionality reduction, and we'll experiment with both in this chapter. \n",
    "\n",
    "In a supervised classification task, a user provides examples of data that fall into certain discrete classes (for example, _healthy_ and _disease_), and tries to have the computer develop a model that can differentiate those classes based on the defined features. If successful, the resulting model could be applied to data where the class isn't known ahead of time, in attempt to predict the class from the features. \n",
    "\n",
    "Dimensionality reduction tasks, on the other hand, generally don't have classes or labels assigned ahead of time, and the user is hoping to identify which samples are most similar to each other based on new features that are defined by the algorithm. The goal here might be to reduce the number of features from thousands or more to around two or three that explain most of the variation in the data. This allows the user to explore the samples visually, for example in a scatter plot, which would not be feasible if there were thousands of features.\n",
    "\n",
    "````{margin}\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "[scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/) is a popular and well-documented Python library for machine learning which many bioinformatics researchers and software developers use in their work. If you'd like to start trying some of these tools out, scikit-learn is a great place to start.\n",

    "## Supervised classification with Naive Bayes\n",
    "\n",
    "The first algorithm that we'll look at in this chapter is called _Naive Bayes_, and it is a **supervised classification** algorithm.  We'll implement Naive Bayes to gain an understanding of how it works, and I think you'll discover that this idea of machines learning isn't quite as mysterious or science fiction-y as it sounds. The math involved in Naive Bayes is relatively straight-forward, which is why I chose this algorithm to present here. There are many machine algorithms with more complex math, but Naive Bayes is  widely used and powerful, so it's a good place to get started. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Defining a classification problem\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll explore machine learning classifiers in the context of a now familiar topic: taxonomic classification of 16S rRNA sequences. We previously explored this problem in {doc}`database-searching`, so it's worth spending a few minutes skimming that chapter if it's not fresh in your mind.\n",
    "\n",
    "Briefly, the problem that we are going to address here is as follows. We have a query sequence ($q_i$) which is not taxonomically annotated (meaning we don't know the taxonomy of the organism whose genome it is found in), and a reference database ($R$) of taxonomically annotated sequences ($r_1, r_2, r_3, r_n$). We want to infer a taxonomic annotation for $q_i$. We'll again work with [Greengenes](http://greengenes.secondgenome.com/), a 16S rRNA sequence database, which we'll access using [QIIME default reference project](https://github.com/biocore/qiime-default-reference). (This should all sound very familiar - if not, I again suggest that you review {doc}`database-searching`.)\n",
    "\n",
    "In a classification task, there are two or more pre-defined classes, and the goal is to assign observations to those classes. A classic example of this outside of bioinformatics is an email spam filter. For every email that is received, the spam filter must define it as spam or not spam so the message can directed either to the user's spam folder or the user's inbox. The stakes can be high: a filter that is too permissive will cause the user's inbox to get filled with junk mail, while a filter that is overly restrictive could cause relevant messages to be directed to the spam folder. In either case, the email user could miss important messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of taxonomic assignment, our classes will be taxonomic groups at a user-defined taxonomic level. For example, a phylum classifier for 16S rRNA sequences would take an unannotated sequence as input and as output present the phylum that the sequence most likely originated from.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Naive Bayes classifiers\n",
    "\n",
    "Naive Bayes classifiers work by building a model of what different classes look like based on labeled data that the user provides as input. In the case of taxonomic assignment of 16S sequences, the classes are different microbial taxonomy names at a given taxonomic level. For example, Proteobacteria and Cyanobacteria would be two classes if we were building a classifier for bacterial phyla. The data that is provided would be the 16S sequences associated with different representatives of the classes, but more specifically Naive Bayes needs these sequences broken into finer-grained features for it to work well. Features of sequences could be nearly anything, such as sequence length, presence or absence of certain sequence patterns (or motifs), GC content, and so on. The most commonly used features for sequence classification tasks such as this is {ref}`overlapping kmers <kmer>`, which we have previously seen when looking at heuristic algorithms for database searching.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, instead of using sequence alignment to identify the most likely taxonomic origin of a sequence, we'll train classifiers by building {ref}`kmer <kmer>`-based models of the 16S sequences of taxa in our reference database. We'll then run our query sequences through those models to identify the most likely taxonomic origin of each query sequence. Since we know the taxonomic origin of our query sequences in this case, we can evaluate the accuracy of our classifiers by seeing how often they return the known taxonomy assignment. If our training and testing approaches are well-designed, the performance on our tests will inform us of how accurate we can expect our classifier to be on data where the actual taxonomic origin is unknown. \n",
    "\n",
    "We'll begin by {ref}`preparing our reference database and query sequences as we did previously <load-qdr>`."

Up to this point, we've left out an important piece of information: how confident should we be in our assignment, or in other words, how dependent is our taxonomy assignment on our specific query? If there were slight differences in our query (e.g., because we observed a very closely related organism, such as one of the same species but a different strain, or because we sequenced a different region of the 16S sequence) would we obtain the same taxonomy assignment?
