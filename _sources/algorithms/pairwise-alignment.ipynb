    "# Pairwise sequence alignment \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most fundamental problems in bioinformatics is determining how similar a pair of biological sequences are. There are many applications for this, including inferring the biological function of a new protein sequence, the source organism of an observed DNA sequence, and performing molecular phylogenetics to develop hypotheses about the relatedness of organisms. On the surface this seems like a pretty straight-forward problem, not one that would have been at the center of decades of research and the subject of one of the most cited papers in modern biology {cite}`Altschul1990-ds`. In this chapter we'll explore why determining biological sequence similarity is harder than it might initially seem, and learn about *pairwise sequence alignment*, the standard approach for determining sequence similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you have three protein sequences - call them ``r1``and ``r2`` (*r* is for *reference*) and ``q1`` (*q* is for *query*) - and you want to know whether ``q1`` is more similar to ``r1`` or ``r2``. On the surface, it seems like you could just count the number of positions where they differ (i.e., compute the [Hamming distance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance) between them) to figure this out. Here's what this would look like using an implementation of Hamming distance from the SciPy Python library."

The whale hemoglobin has a smaller Hamming distance (i.e., it's more similar) to the human hemoglobin sequence than to the chicken hemoglobin sequences. Whales and humans are both mammals while chickens are birds, thus whales are humans are more closely related to one another than either is to birds.

This is a profound concept that we risk taking for granted now.

    "I'm going to summarize how to do this algorithmically for the moment, and we'll come back to this in more detail later in this chapter. Briefly, what we want to do is start with the longest diagonal and trace it backwards to transcribe the alignment by writing down the characters from each of the two sequences at every row and column corresponding to the diagonal that you're following. When we encounter a break in the diagonal, we find the next longest diagonal that starts in a cell that is up and/or to the left of the cell when the previous diagonal you were following ends. For every cell that you move straight upwards (non-diagonally), we insert a gap in the sequence on the horizontal axis of your matrix. For every cell that you move straight leftwards, you'd insert a gap in the sequence on the vertical axis of your matrix.\n",

    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Exercise\n",

    "### Why this simple procedure is too simplistic \n",
    "\n",
    "I suggested above that you keep a list of assumptions that are made by this approach. Here are a couple of the very problematic ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We're scoring all matches as 1 and all mismatches as -1. This suggests that all matches are equally likely, and all mismatches are equally unlikely. What's a more biologically meaningful way to do this (think about protein sequences here)?\n",
    "2. Similarly, every gap that is introduced results in the same penalty being incurred. Based on what we know about how insertion/deletion events occur, what do you think is a more biologically meaningful way to do this?\n",
    "\n",
    "All scoring schemes have limitations, and you should remember that when you're working with software that generates alignments for you (e.g., systems such as [BLAST](http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi)). Especially as you're getting started in bioinformatics, it's easy to forget that and just accept the result from computer software as \"the right answer\". You'll need to determine if you agree with the result that a computational system gives you, which will involve examining the result in the context of what you know about the biology of the systems your studying. Algorithms such as the one we just explored are there to help you do your work, but they won't do your work for you. Their answers are based on models (in this example, how we model matches, mismatches, and gaps) and as you're learning here, the models are not perfect. Be skeptical of automated approaches to solve complex problems! \n",
    "\n",
    "Another important consideration as we think about algorithms for aligning pairs of sequences is how long an algorithm will take to run as a function of the input it's provided (or in technical terminology, the [computational complexity](http://bigocheatsheet.com/) of the algorithm). When searching a sequence against a database (for example, to get an idea of what its function is), you may have billions of bases to search against, which would correspond to billions of columns in one of the matrices we just computed. Computers are fast, but the data sets you're going to be working with are very large and in many cases growing exponentially in size over time. Working in bioinformatics, it's inevitable that you're going to begin to discover the limitations of the algorithms and software you use. Runtime and memory requirements are the usual culprits. Because the data sets are getting bigger more quickly than computers are getting faster (at least as of this writing), just waiting for computers to get faster won't work. We need smart people who understand some computer science and some biology to design clever algorithms, software, and analytic techniques to enable the next generation of advances that technologies like high-throughput DNA sequencing are promising. (And there are a lot of people who want to spend good money to pay people who can do these things, so keep reading!)\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the next several sections we'll explore ways of addressing the two issues noted above. We'll introduce the problem of the computational complexity of pairwise sequence alignment at the end of this chapter, and explore approaches for addressing that (i.e., making database searching faster) in the next chapter.\n",

    "When amino acids are joined to create a protein molecule, they are covalently linked to other amino acids. As a result, they can no longer technically be classified as amino acids. We therefore refer to them as residues of amino acids, or **residues** for short.\n",
    "```\n",
    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "When aligning nucleotide sequences, using a simple two-value scoring scheme (where  all matches are scored with one value and all mismatches with another value) is common, but this approach is overly simplistic for protein sequences. In this section, we're going to switch gears to talking about protein alignment. The most commonly used algorithms are the same for nucleotides and proteins, so most of the ideas that we'll discuss here are general to both. With protein sequences, we're aligning **amino acid residues** (or **residues**, for short) to one another, instead of nucleotides.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's talk about why two-value scoring schemes are too simplistic for protein alignment. In a protein, each amino acid residue is contributing to the structure and/or function of the protein. A given amino acid residue may contribute a charge to an enzyme that helps it to bind its substrate, it may introduce structural stability or instability in a protein, or provide spacing between different functional domains of the protein. Substitutions between amino acids that have similar chemical or physical properties tend to be better tolerated (i.e., less detrimental to the function of the protein) than substitutions between amino acids with different chemical or physical properties. It therefore makes sense to account for the chemical and physical properties of the amino acids being aligned when scoring matches and mismatches.\n",

    "```\n",

    "Because the sodium-potassium pump is a membrane-bound protein, it has regions that are composed of long stretches of polar or charged residues, which facilitate being positioned inside or outside of the cell, and regions that are composed of long stretches of non-polar residues, which facilitate being positioned within the cell membrane. If a mutation occurs in a gene encoding a sodium-potassium pump that substitutes a non-polar residue for another non-polar residue, that will likely be less disruptive to the protein's function than if a polar residue is substituted for a non-polar residue. This is because the non-polar residue is likely to be in the membrane-bound region of the protein (since that's where most of the non-polar residues are in this protein), and polar residues destabilize membrane-bound proteins when they are present within the membrane (a highly non-polar environment). Given this knowledge of amino acids and proteins, when aligning a pair of protein sequences, we probably want to score the alignment of a non-polar residue with a polar residue as less likely than with another non-polar residue.\n",
    "\n",
    "To score matches and mismatches differently based on which pair of amino acid residues are being aligned, our alignment algorithm is redefined to incorporate a **substitution matrix**, which defines the score associated with substitution of one amino acid for another.

In a second matrix, $T$, draw an arrow from the cell that you're currently defining the score for in $F$ to the cell whose score it depends on.

In this way, you're determining whether the best (highest) score is obtained by inserting a gap in sequence 1 (corresponding to $F(i-1, j) - d$), inserting a gap in sequence 2 (corresponding to $F(i, j-1) - d$), or aligning the characters in sequence 1 and sequence 2 (corresponding to $F(i-1, j-1) + s(c_i, c_j)$).\n",

Remember to insert arrows in $T$ indicating which cell each score was derived from as you fill in the matrix. If you're deriving the score for a given cell in $F$ from the cell diagonally up and to the left, you should put a diagonal arrow in $T$ (↖).\n",

    "\n",
    "Calling the steps we just described is labor-intensive, and they don't change regardless of the protein sequences that we want to align. So, as a bioinformatics software developer, you'd want to make this functionality more easily accessible to users. To do that, you'd define a function that takes all of the necessary input and provides the aligned sequences and the score as output, without requiring the user to make several function calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think for a minute about how you'd define this function. What are the required inputs? What would the function provide as output? What would be a good name for the function? (Naming functions is hard: you want the name to be self-documenting, so users know what the function does, but you also want it to be concise because you and your users will be typing it often.) Write your answers to these questions down. What you're doing here is sketching an *Application Programmer Interface*, or *API* for a function. Defining APIs is a bit of an art and a bit of a science, and there are great APIs and horrible APIs. API definition is hard, and it's something that you get better at with practice. Spending time thinking about APIs is important for developers, as it's how your users will interact with your code. There is a lot of good code out there that no one uses because it has a bad API.\n",

    "Some applications of global alignment use both the alignment score and the aligned sequences, and some only use one or the other. As a result, some applications optimize this process by only keeping track of the information they need. For example, if you're working on a database search algorithm, you might only care about the score of the alignment. In this case you might not need to keep track of $T$, and could reduce the amount of memory that your software requires by not keeping track of it.\n",

    "The alignment we just constructed is a *global alignment*, meaning we align both sequences from their beginning through their end. This has some important specific applications: for example, if we have two full-length protein sequences, and we have a crystal structure for one of them, we can use global alignment to give us a direct mapping between all positions in both sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is in contrast to local alignment, where we have a pair of sequences that we suspect may partially overlap each other, and we want to know what the best possible alignment of all or part of one sequence is with all or part of the other sequences. Perhaps the most widely used application of this is in sequence database searching (e.g., [the BLAST web server](http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi)), where we have a query sequence and we want to find the closest match (or matches) in a reference database containing many different gene sequences. In this case, the whole reference database could be represented as a single sequence, as we could perform a local alignment against it to find the region that contains the highest scoring match.\n",

    "The algorithm that is most commonly used for performing local alignment was originally published by Temple F. Smith and Michael S. Waterman (1981) {cite}`Smith1981-ye`, and is therefore referred to as Smith-Waterman alignment. In terms of the resulting alignment, the difference between Smith-Waterman and Needleman-Wunsch is that the aligned sequences in Smith-Waterman can be a subsequence of one or both of the unaligned (input) sequences. In Needleman-Wunsch alignment, the aligned sequences will be full-length with respect to the unaligned sequences.\n",

    "Algorithmically, Smith-Waterman is nearly identical to Needleman-Wunsch, with three small but important differences. We'll now work through Smith-Waterman alignment following the same steps that we followed for Needleman-Wunsch, and look at the differences as we go. We'll redefine our two sequences to align here. As you did for Needleman-Wunsch, after working through this example with these sequences, come back here and experiment with different sequences."

    "This was a lot of complicated material, so congratulations on making it this far. If you feel comfortable with everything we just went through, you now understand the basics of pairwise alignment, which is easily the most fundamental algorithm in bioinformatics. If you're not feeling totally comfortable with all of this, go back and re-read it. This time spend more time working out the individual steps with a pencil and paper by computing more cells in $F$ and $T$ as you go, and performing the traceback step manually. And don't get discouraged: we can describe the steps that need to be carried out to a computer with just a few lines of code, so it's nothing magical. Computing a pairwise alignment just involves the systematic application of a few well defined steps. You *will* be able to carry out those steps (a metric of your understanding of the algorithm) as long as you put a bit of effort into performing those steps.\n",

    "## Differential scoring of gaps \n",
    "\n",
    "The second limitation of the our simple alignment algorithm (which we discussed way back at the beginning of this chapter, and one that is also present in the versions of Needleman-Wunsch and Smith-Waterman implemented above, is that all gaps are scored equally whether they represent the opening of a new insertion/deletion, or the extension of an existing insertion/deletion. This isn't ideal based on what we know about how insertion/deletion events occur (see [this discussion of replication slippage](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK21114/) {cite}`Brown2002-lb` if you're not familiar with the biological process that is thought to lead to small insertions as deletions). Instead, we might want to incur a large penalty for opening a gap, but a smaller penalty for extending an existing gap. This is referred to as *affine gap scoring*.\n",
    "\n",
    "To score gap extensions differently from gap creations (or gap opens), we need to modify the terms corresponding to the addition of gaps in our scoring function. When we compute the score corresponding to a gap in our alignment (i.e., where we'd insert either a ↑ or a ← in $T$), we should incur a *gap extension penalty* if the value in $T$ that the new arrow will point to is the same type of arrow. Otherwise, we should incur the *gap open penalty*. If we represent our gap open penalty as $d^0$, and our gap extend penalty as $d^e$, our scoring scheme would look now like the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "F(i, j) = max \\left(\\begin{align}\n",
    "& 0\\\\\n",
    "& F(i-1, j-1) + s(c_i, c_j)\\\\\n",
    "& \\left\\{\\begin{array}{l l} F(i-1, j) - d^e \\quad \\text{if $T(i-1, j)$ is ↑}\\\\ F(i-1, j) - d^o \\quad \\text{if $T(i-1, j)$ is not ↑} \\end{array}  \\right\\} \\\\\n",
    "& \\left\\{\\begin{array}{l l} F(i, j-1) - d^e \\quad \\text{if $T(i, j-1)$ is ←}\\\\ F(i, j-1) - d^o \\quad \\text{if $T(i, j-1)$ is not ←} \\end{array}  \\right\\}\n",
    " \\end{align}\\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice how we only use the gap extend penalty if the previous max score resulted from a gap in the same sequence because it represents the continuation of an existing gap in that sequence. We know which sequence a gap is being introduced in by the characters in the traceback matrix: ↑ always implies a gap in the sequence on the horizontal axis of $F$ and $T$, and ← always implies a gap in the sequence on the vertical axis of $F$ and $T$.\n",
    "\n",
    "And here's a quick quiz: is this a Smith-Waterman or Needleman-Wunsch scoring function? How do you know?\n",
    "\n",

Both of these can be limiting factors for applications that require sequence alignments, so a lot of effort is spent understanding how to optimize sequence alignment.\n",

    "We just worked through a few algorithms for pairwise sequence alignment, and ran some toy examples based on short sequences.

This is because ``local_pairwise_align_ssw`` is a much more efficient implementation of Smith-Waterman alignment, and it additionally applies some cool tricks that allow it to not compute all of the values in $F$ and $T$, but still get the right answer most of the time. This is referred to as a *heuristic* approach to optimizing an algorithm. We'll spend some time defining and comparing heuristics in the Database Searching chapter, but to get you to start thinking about it, what you care about is how much a heuristic reduces the run time of an algorithm, and how often it gives you the same answer as the full algorithm.

    "This looks to be a [quadratic relationship](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_time): the increase in runtime is proportional to the square of sequence length. If you think back to the computation of $F$ and $T$, this makes sense. If our sequences are each five bases long, our matrices will have five rows and five columns, so $5 \\times 5 = 25$ cells that need to be filled in by performing some numeric computations. If we double our sequences lengths to ten, our matrices will have ten rows and ten columns, so $10 \\times 10 = 100$ cells that need to be filled in. Because each of the numeric computations take roughly the same amount of time (you can take that on faith, or prove it to yourself using ``timeit``), when we double our sequence length we have four times as many cells to compute.\n",
    "\n",
    "When runtime scales quadratically, that can be a practical limitation for an algorithm. We'd much prefer to see a linear relationship (i.e., if we double our sequence length, our runtime doubles). But this is an inherent issue with pairwise alignment, so it's one that we need to deal with.\n",
    "\n",
    "One question you might have is whether developing a version of this algorithm which can run in parallel on multiple processors would be an effective way to make it scale to larger data sets. In the next cell, we look and how the plot would change if we could run the alignment process over four processors."

    "Notice that the runtimes in the plot are smaller, but shape of the curve is the same. While parallelization can reduce the runtime of an algorithm, it won't change its *computational complexity* (or how its runtime scales as a function of its input size). You can explore the computational complexity of different types of algorithms in the [Big-O Cheat Sheet](http://bigocheatsheet.com/), though it's a fairly advanced introduction to the topic (and one that's usually covered in the second or third year for Computer Science majors).\n",

    "### Conclusions on the scalability of pairwise sequence alignment with Smith-Waterman \n",
    "\n",
    "These are pretty long sequences that we're working with here, and the runtime is still pretty reasonable (only a few seconds for DNA sequences around 100,000 bases), so that suggests this implementation of Smith-Waterman should work ok for aligning pairs of sequences, even if the sequences are fairly long. However, we're often interested in doing more than just pairwise alignment. For example, we may want to align many sequences to each other (which we'll explore in the Multiple Sequence Alignment chapter), or we may want to perform many pairwise alignments (which we'll explore in the Database Searching chapter). In the next chapter we'll begin exploring ways to address this scalability issue by approximating solutions to the problem.\n",
