    "This book can be read statically or interactively. The simplest way to read interactively is with [Binder](https://mybinder.org/). When chapters are available to read interactively, you'll see a rocket ship icon toward the top-right of the page. The current page can be read interactively, allowing you to execute the following code block (making any modifications you choose to make). If you'd like to try it out, click the rocket ship icon, and then the Launch Binder box that pops up beneath it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Code blocks will be presented throughout the book. If you're reading a static version of the book, the output of running the code will be presented below the code block. If you're reading an interactive version of the book, you'll have to run the code cell to see the output. \n",
