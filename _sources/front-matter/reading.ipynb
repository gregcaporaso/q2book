    "# Reading this book\n",
    "\n",
    "This book is intended to be read sequentially and will teach you everything you need to know to get started using QIIME 2 for your own microbiome research using example data sets along the way. As you learn to use the tools, you'll be introduced to underlying theory in microbiome bioinformatics. I also sprinkle in tips and tricks on how to get more out of QIIME 2, including how I use QIIME 2, so you'll be a QIIME 2 power user by the time you're done!  \n",
    "\n",
    "If you'd like to learn more about the underlying algorithms used in microbiome research, many of those are covered in my other book, _[An Introduction to Applied Bioinformatics 2nd Edition](http://readIAB.org)_. Many of the algorithms discussed in that book are fundamentals of bioinformatics, so if you're interested in becoming a bioinformatician or bioinformatics software developer, you should read these.  \n",

    "\n",
    "This book can be read statically or interactively. The simplest way to read interactively is with [Binder](https://mybinder.org/). When chapters are available to read interactively, you'll see a rocket ship icon toward the top-right of the page. The current page can be read interactively, allowing you to execute the following code block (making any modifications you choose to make). If you'd like to try it out, click the rocket ship icon, and then the Launch Binder box that pops up beneath it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Code blocks will be presented throughout the book. If you're reading a static version of the book, the output of running the code will be presented below the code block. If you're reading an interactive version of the book, you'll have to run the code cell to see the output. \n",
